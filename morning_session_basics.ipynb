    "### Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a very powerful high-level programming language. In this tutorial, we will be using python 3 and discuss a few core libraries in python. Although one can install python and all required packages one-by-one, that is a lot of work, and hence we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Anaconda is a python/R distributor which provides most necessary python packages and libraries at one place. Please follow the instructions provided in [Anaconda Documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After conda is installed, please create a virtual environment for this course (highly recommended). To set up a virtual environment called \"mintec2023\", please run the following command. Also, you can follow the instructions in [Managing Environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "To activate and enter the environment, run conda activate mintec2023. To deactivate the environment, either run conda deactivate mintec2023 or exit the terminal. Note that every time you want to work on the assignment, you should re-run conda activate mintec2023."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we jump into the tutorial, we need to talk about notebooks. A Jupyter notebook lets you write and execute Python code locally in your web browser. Jupyter notebooks make it very easy to play around with code and execute it in bits and pieces; for this reason they are widely used in scientific computing. Colab on the other hand is Google’s flavor of Jupyter notebooks that is particularly suited for machine learning and data analysis and that runs entirely in the cloud. Colab is basically Jupyter notebook on steroids: it’s free, requires no setup, comes preinstalled with many packages, is easy to share with the world, and benefits from free access to hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs (with some caveats).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish to run the notebook locally with Jupyter, make sure your virtual environment is installed correctly (as per the setup instructions), activate it, then run pip install jupyter. And then run jupyter-notebook to launch a jupyter-notebook"

However, before adding to `x` we first chechk if the letter is a `_`, and in that case we replace it with a space ` `. In practice, this means we are replacing underscores with spaces. Of course there are simpler ways to do such a common operation! \n",
